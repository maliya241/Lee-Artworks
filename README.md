Lee Artworks is an art business started by Harper Lee (not the author). She can create art with any medium, but her speciality is drawing and designing. She chose her color scheme and designed her logo. With her approval, I set up the layout of the website. We discussed multiple times what she needed and wanted her website to have and what I had the ability to do or was willing to try to build. Throughout the whole process, I showed her my progress, talked about new changes that needed to happen, and requested more materials. 

For this project, I integrated PHP, jQuery, and JavaScript as I learned them. With PHP, I was able to create boxes that would display randomly selected pictures of Harper’s artwork. With the help of PHP Mailer, I was also able to put a user’s form inputs into an email that would be sent to a Lee Artworks’ email. I used jQuery to change the links in the last image in a row. The form required jQuery and JavaScript.
